    <div class="blurb">In this reading, Freire emphasizes that reading is not just decoding words -- that the act of reading cannot be separated from knowledge of the real world. When I first encountered these ideas, I was definitely a bit confused. I had never been asked to think about the act of reading very deeply before. I knew that I liked to read, and what types of things I liked to read, but I hadn’t ever thought too hard about the context I bring to what I am reading, and how what I am reading may affect the way I perceive the world around me. Although I initially felt some resistance to these questions, I think our discussions in class helped me to see their importance, and see more clearly the way books, even made-up novels, are always referencing the real world in some way or another, and making subtle claims about how the real world works. One interesting quote from this reading is when Freire talks about how he learned to read: “Deciphering the word flowed naturally from reading my particular world; it was not something superimposed on it.” I feel like this ties in to our later discussions in class around phonics, which are quite far from being naturally connected to reading the world. The phonics method of learning to read completely ignores the knowledge and context of the world required to read well. </div>

    <div class="blurb">For this reading, we read a picture book that showed the same story from four different perspectives. We read the book through four times, trying to believe one of the voices each time. I found this activity interesting because it showed how readers use their background knowledge to try to decide whether a narrator is trustworthy or not. Sometimes two people might make very different assumptions about whether a perspective in a book is reliable or not! Another thing that made this activity memorable was simply the quality of the book. Although the story was short and simple, there was a ton of grey area in the interpretation, and the illustrations were amazing and detailed. Reading this book a number of times made me realize how sophisticated picture books can be, and how much the pictures can add to the story that is being told. The pictures help provide context to the story, which is interesting because when you are reading a non-picture book you are asked to provide this context yourself, by visualizing the different characters and settings. So for picture books the pictures tell you what world the story is taking place in, whereas for other books you can impose your world onto the words.</div>

    <div class="blurb">I’m actually not 100% sure on the date of this discussion, but I remember pretty early on in the course we had a discussion about how limiting having to teach pre-written curriculum can be. This is a great example of an overall theme for me throughout the course, which is that I learned a ton just from being in the room with my other classmates. Coming into this semester I had very little knowledge on what teaching is like besides what I know from being a student, so it was amazing to gain more context about the profession by listening to conversations in class. In this case, Kelly was talking about how having to teach the common core has really taken away from the amount of time her classes have for free time, recess, and other unstructured activities, where kids learn valuable soft skills. There seemed to be general agreement in the room that there is too much required curriculum these days. Before I heard this, I had kind of just automatically accepted the narrative I had heard from the news that standardized curriculum is better. However after hearing all of my classmates’ perspectives I definitely see the tradeoffs of teaching canned lessons.</div>
    <div style="height: 80px"></div>
    <div class="blurb">Another discussion we had that really made me think was around why many kids stop reading during middle school. I think we read a news article about this phenomenon, and how kids start to see reading as a chore instead of something they would do for fun. The article suggested that the cause of this is that around middle school age we start to ask kids to do literary analysis of what they are reading, rather than just doing a simple summary at the end, or better yet, not having to do anything but read it. This definitely rang true to me, and I really enjoyed our discussion around how we can make reading more appealing to middle school and older kids. Reading can be really fun, but when we start to associate it with assigned work, and start assigning books from the early 1900s, that can definitely make it more of a chore. I also got the sense from our discussion that it can feel safer to assign books from the canon. No parent or administrator is going to look twice at you if you are teaching Shakespeare or To Kill a Mockingbird, but if you are having your class read a modern YA novel, you might be more wary of having to justify that to others at the school. This ties in to the “Gender is like an Ocean” documentary, where the teacher said that she believes risk-taking is a necessity in teaching. Plus, every generation of kids has different influences in their lives, so it wouldn’t make sense for the curriculum to stay the same across many generations.</div>

    <div class="blurb">This reading was a very important step in my journey through this class, because it put in writing some of the feelings I had been having towards the work we were doing in class. Specifically, the author mentions as one of the categories of responses to socio-political critiques of children’s books, “students expressed cynicism and said that we read too much into the books.” I think that is a pretty good characterization of a common instinctual response I would have when we got into the weeds of how a book might be oppressive in subtle ways. So doing this reading was thought-provoking for me, as the author explored the different resistances his students had to these sorts of discussions. When we discussed this reading in class, and read “The Five Chinese Brothers” for ourselves, I had to admit that there were some obviously problematic aspects of the book, despite how entertaining or nostalgic the story might be for me. Overall, my experience with this reading was very “meta,” if that makes sense, because the study is done by a teacher who is teaching critical literacy studies to pre-service teachers, and I am also a teacher-in-training being taught what is essentially critical literacy studies by another name. It was difficult, but productive, to try to come to terms with what resistance I might find in my own thought patterns towards calling out the racism and other prejudices in classic books.</div>
    <div style="height: 80px"></div>
    <div class="blurb">For my first choice assignment, I made a manga book stack. As I was exploring different candidates, and with the background knowledge I had gained from the course already, I noticed right away how over-sexualized female characters are in a lot of Manga. This was especially true because a lot of the series my mind first jumped to were in the “Shonen” genre, which is written mainly for a male audience. Regardless, I was noticing now the clear sexism in books that I had loved throughout my childhood and young adulthood, and thinking about how it might have affected me to be reading that type of stuff all the time. I also struggled with getting my APA formatting right during this first assignment -- it was definitely a bit of a transition going from computer science assignments to education assignments. When I submitted this assignment, I felt I had done a pretty good job. It was a lot of work to figure out what books I wanted to choose and do a write-up for each one. However, when I got my grade back it was lower than I had expected, which was a wake-up call that I needed to step my game up. The last humanities classes I had taken were earlier in undergraduate, and I think I didn’t fully realize what the standard was for Master’s level written work.</div>
    <div style="height: 80px"></div>
    <div class="blurb">This isn’t really a reading technically, but I think it qualifies as something we digested outside of class and then discussed later. This documentary was amazing to watch -- the students and teachers in it were all passionate and inspiring. Before watching this, I didn’t have a great idea of what teaching LGBT issues in a classroom would look like, but this showed a great example of how to put trust in students and let them control the course of a project. I think the aspect of the project that I will take away with me to my teaching career is that sometimes less is more in terms of assignment instructions. But this takeaway is very context dependent. If a teacher is struggling to get buy-in from their students, they might have to provide a more detailed rubric to get them to do any work. What was so amazing about the documentary was that the students were very self motivated to execute a cool project, and didn’t see the lack of clear guidelines as an excuse to be lazy. This film got me inspired to think of what assignments I can create for my future students that would allow them to explore their creativity. It was interesting to see that when given a more free form assignment, each group of students was allowed to cater the project to their particular strengths and interests, instead of having to perform the same task as everyone else.</div>
    <div style="height: 60px"></div>
    <div class="blurb">When Dr. Simon zoomed into our class, I was very impressed by his knowledge and passion. It felt like every question we asked him he had thought about before and could talk about for a while, which really showed how careful and thorough he is during his research. It was pretty cool to be able to bring questions about the documentary to the person who conceptualized it in the first place -- that is a rare privilege! What I most wanted to emulate about his outlook on teaching was his admiration of young students. He really thinks young people are capable of amazing things, and talked a lot about getting out of their way and letting their ideas shine. This was captured well in the documentary, and is also a general philosophy of this class, so I saw a lot of overlap there. Another thing that stuck with me from this discussion was what Dr. Simon called “pre-requisites” for the type of free-flowing instruction that was practiced in “Gender is like an Ocean.” He emphasized many times that the school he was researching at in the film happened to already have a very good community, because the students and teachers had known each other for many years. So when he started the project, he didn’t have to try to build community -- everyone already had a high enough comfort level with each other to have challenging conversations about gender and sexuality. </div>
    <div style="height: 40px"></div>
    <div class="blurb">For my second choice assignment, I did a storyteller analysis of a mangaka (manga writer). This assignment was satisfying for me, because I felt way more comfortable with the subject at that point in the semester than when I was working on the second choice assignment. It also helped that I had APA formatting mostly down by that point. I enjoyed pulling in readings from throughout the class to help me analyze “My Hero Academia” -- it gave me the feeling that I was pulling it all together. It is one thing to participate in the class discussions around books, but it is a whole different skill to be able to read literature critically on your own, and this made the assignment challenging in a good way. I also found it interesting to consider an author’s body of work as a whole, rather than one of their books in isolation. One of our readings talked about how an author’s worldview is under the surface of everything they write, which I do think is partly true, but it is confusing to reconcile this idea with an author that has written many books with a variety of viewpoints and value systems. Is it always possible to find commonalities between two of an author’s works, even if they seem to be very different at first glance? Anyways, I enjoyed this assignment a lot, and although grades aren’t everything, it helped me have a feeling of growth that I got a better grade on it than the book stack. </div>
